Description: Utilizes the 'lme4' and 'optimx' packages (previously the optim()
    function from 'stats') to estimate (generalized) linear mixed models (GLMM)
    with factor structures using a profile likelihood approach, as outlined in
    Jeon and Rabe-Hesketh (2012) <doi:10.3102/1076998611417628> and
    Rockwood and Jeon (2019) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2018.1516541>.
    Factor analysis and item response models can be extended to allow
    for an arbitrary number of nested and crossed random effects,
    making it useful for multilevel and cross-classified models.
